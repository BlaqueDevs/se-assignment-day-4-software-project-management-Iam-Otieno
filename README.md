Construction Management Software: E.g., a tool for a large infrastructure project with set phases (design, build, inspect) that don’t change.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance (QA) in a Software Project
Automated Testing: Use tools like Selenium or JUnit to run unit, integration, and regression tests consistently.
Manual Testing: Conduct exploratory testing for edge cases automation might miss.
Code Reviews: Implement peer reviews or pair programming to catch errors early.
Continuous Integration (CI): Integrate and test code frequently (e.g., via Jenkins) to detect issues in real-time.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before code to ensure functionality meets requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate with end-users to confirm the product meets expectations.
Static Analysis: Use tools like SonarQube to identify code smells or vulnerabilities.
Performance Testing: Simulate load (e.g., with JMeter) to ensure scalability and speed.
Documentation: Maintain clear specs and test plans for traceability and consistency.
Regular QA Checkpoints: Embed QA in sprints (Agile) or phases (Waterfall) to monitor progress.

Why Maintaining High Standards is Important
Reliability: Ensures software performs as expected, reducing crashes or bugs.
Customer Trust: Delivers a polished product, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.
